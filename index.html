        You can make the bang bang sauce a day or two in advance. <br> it covered in the refrigerator until ready to
        use.
    </p>
    <p class="aqua">
        Allow the sauce to sit at room temperature while the shrimp is frying to<br> give it a chance to warm up. This
        way you’re not left with tepid shrimp<br> after tossing them in the cold-from-the-fridge sauce.

        I like to add shredded cabbage to my tacos to give a contrast of textures<br> and to temper the heat of the
        sauce a bit. The shrimp is served in<br> warmed flour tortillas; but, if you want to cut down on carbs, you
        can<br> serve them in lettuce leaves instead.

        I garnish my tacos with thinly sliced radishes and jalapeños, lime wedges,<br> chopped cilantro, and green
        onions. Letting my crew customize their<br> tacos is always a hit.
